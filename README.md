# Eye Event Detection

A notebook comparing the use of HMM, I-VT, I-DT, and Microsaccade algorithms to detect fixations. I used Titus Malsburg's R package Saccades (https://shorturl.at/oXbAk), based on the based on Engbert & Kliegl's Microsaccades algorithm for this paper (https://shorturl.at/Bhvdn). The version of that algorithm in the notebook doesn't yet include the process to filter blinks.

Notebook with some functions for detecting eye events and comparing algorithms.
